Idea: 

We will create a decentralized platform that allows users to save and invest their assets in a transparent and accessible manner using BTTC tech!!


## ‚ú® Features

- Fast Swappings
- AI Analytics to give personalized advisory recommendation!!
- tokens and pools!!


## üèÜ Description
- Milestone 1 : Have gotten a clear idea of what to do with Mudrafi: swap, pools tokens and ai analytics
- Milestone 2 : Completed frontend for the same!!
- Milestone 3 : Deployed smart contracts required for MudraFi on tronscan!!
- Milestone 4 : Working on it { would be connecting frontend to web3 }



## üí∞ Future of MudraFi

- In the next update of MudraFi, Web3 completion will be done by connecting it to frontend i.e our smart contracts are deployed on Tron IDE and just needed to connect it to the UI.

- With future enhancements of TRC-20 token, MudraFi empowered with the less expensive, more secure and high speed transactions on the platform. And also facilitates the scalability and usability of the platform.

- In order to empower users to buy, sell and hold tokens on the MudraFi on different Blockchain more wallets options will be provided along with TronLink and MetaMask in the future .

- We will come up with a massive upgrade in AI Analytics which will work on personalized advisory recommendations based on user preferences and behaviour. Suggest and advise about trading and swapping on tron like potential risk of loss or not a good time to buy or remind about the user's based tokens interest

- With TronGrid and the TronWeb, our platform will develop seamless Tron Network on which transactions of swapping tokens and liquidity pools will get to a whole new level . With this Tron Network enabled in MudraFi more tokens options and choices will be added for the users.

- For Future competence, Mudrafi will be using BTTC that enables interoperability with the public chains of Ethereum, TRON, and BSC, with more chains to be supported in the future.

To merge your changes from the cloned repository back into the original repository on GitHub, you typically follow these steps:

- Step 1: Add the original repository as a remote (if you haven't done it already)

Navigate to the directory of your local clone:

```bash
cd /path/to/local/clone/
```

Add the original repository as a remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream <original_repository_url>
```

In the command above, <original_repository_url> should be replaced with the URL of the original repository. This step is important because it establishes a connection between your local repository and the original repository.

- Step 2: Commit and push your changes to your forked repository

Stage your changes

```bash
git add .
```

Commit the changes

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

Push the changes to your forked repository
