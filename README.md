Contributions are always welcome!

To merge your changes from the cloned repository back into the original repository on GitHub, you typically follow these steps:

- Step 1: Add the original repository as a remote (if you haven't done it already)

Navigate to the directory of your local clone:

```bash
cd /path/to/local/clone/
```

Add the original repository as a remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream <original_repository_url>
```

In the command above, <original_repository_url> should be replaced with the URL of the original repository. This step is important because it establishes a connection between your local repository and the original repository.

- Step 2: Commit and push your changes to your forked repository

Stage your changes

```bash
git add .
```

Commit the changes

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

Push the changes to your forked repository

```bash
git push origin master
```
- Step 3: Create a pull request on the original repository

Now, go to the original repository on GitHub and create a pull request from your forked repository. 




## üí∞ Future of MudraFi

- Web3 completion by connecting it to frontend i.e our smart contracts are deployed and we just needed to connect it to frontend!!
